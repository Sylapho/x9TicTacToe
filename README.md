# x9TicTacToe

x9TicTacToe is a unique twist on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. In this version, each cell is itself a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe grid, creating a more complex and challenging game.

## Description

In x9TicTacToe, the game board is composed of 9 Tic Tac Toe sub-grids. Players take turns to mark a cell in the active sub-grid with their symbol. The active sub-grid for each turn is determined by the cell the previous player marked. The first player to align three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) in a sub-grid wins the game. This adds an extra layer of strategy and complexity to the traditional game of Tic Tac Toe.
